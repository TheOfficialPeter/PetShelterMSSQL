# Pet Shelter Database

This project has two parts:
- Database Design for Pet Shelter Database ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FcrV49veH4JnVoarox5Zig-0FoYG-AYm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104985363915585865483&rtpof=true&sd=true )
- T-SQL Files for setting up the Database ( Project Repository Files )

⚠️ Note: I was not allowed to include the specifications for the project. 

To make explanation easier, all of the files used are placed in the repository with generic names.

**Microsoft SQL** Server was installed and utilised as a database management tool.
